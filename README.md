Title: Sad Zelda

Description: 

We essentially created a hangman game but instead of gallows it is a parachute.  A five letter word is to be guessed, with every wrong guess the user gets a piece of their parachute cut.  Only five tries are allowed before the user reaches the ground.  Will you make it safely down to the ground?

We created a dungeon crawler game.  The goal is to find the sword that will make the enemy beatable! There are walls that are dangerous and will result in death and also confronting the enemy without the secret sword will result in a loss.  

Project Structure:

We have a main program that facilitates the program and has additional vital aspects as well.  We created six classes to help with the software design. We have a few classes that create walls, and the puddle that is in the game.  There are also additional classes that help create the character classes like the villain and the hero.  The wall and puddle classes are children of the "thing" class, those complete the requirements for inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.  Each class can be said to fulfill the requirements for abstraction as they are hiding complexity and making it simpler.  Lastly, we used encapsulation in the Character class, we also used getters, setters, and protection control.
